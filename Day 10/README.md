# Day 10: Binary Numbers
## Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
Given a base-**10** integer, **_n_**, convert it to binary (base-**2**). Then find and print the base- integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in **_n_**'s binary representation.

## Input Format

A single integer, **_n_**.

## Constraints
- **1 <= _n_ <= 10^6**
## Output Format

Print a single base-**10** integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in the binary representation of **_n _**.

## Sample Input 1
```
5
```
## Sample Output 1
```
1
```
## Sample Input 2
```
13
```
## Sample Output 2
```
2
```
## Explanation

_Sample Case 1:_  
The binary representation of **5** is **101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **1**.

_Sample Case 2:_  
The binary representation of **13** is **1101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **2**.
