# Day 1: Data Types
## Objective 
Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables _i_, _d_, and _s_ are already declared and initialized for you. You must declare **3** variables: one of type _int_, one of type _double_, and one of type _String_. Then you must read **3** lines of input from stdin and initialize your **3** variables. Finally, you must use the **+** operator to perform the following operations:

- Print the sum of _i_ plus your int variable on a new line.
- Print the sum of _d_ plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
- Concatenate _s_ with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

**Note:** If you are using a language that doesn't support using **+** for string concatenation (e.g.: **C**), you can just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor must be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, _i_. 
The second line contains a double, _d_. 
The third line contains a string, _s_.

## Output Format

Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to **1** decimal place) on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.
